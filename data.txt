SN Thakur to Chawla, out Kuldeep Yadav Run Out!! Swinging in yorker and a run-out as the keeper lobbed the ball to the bowler who whipped the bails off with the non-stiker stranded in the middle of the crease. Chawla almost fell down failing to wood the yorker and Dhoni behind the sticks did the rest. KKR has derailed pretty badly here. Kuldeep Yadav run out (Dhoni/SN Thakur) 0(0)
SN Thakur to Chawla, THAT'S OUT!! Run Out!!
Kuldeep Yadav, left handed bat, comes to the crease

SN Thakur to Shubman Gill, out Caught by Jadeja!! And a tough learning curve for Shubman Gill is over. Slaps a shortish ball straight down the throat of the man at deep mid. That was slower and Shubman Gill despite timing it found the fielder. KKR have lost the plot here. Shubman Gill c Jadeja b SN Thakur 15(20)
SN Thakur to Shubman Gill, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!

SN Thakur to Shubman Gill, no run, slaps a length ball down to mid-off. No runs as the man at mid-off picked it up and had a shy at the bowler's end

SN Thakur to Shubman Gill, 2 runs, slices a length ball and has been fielded at deep cover. The throw was a loopy one and they take the second
19.2
SN Thakur to Shubman Gill, no run, can I put it down as a drop? Length ball and clattered down the ground for the bowler to his right palm on it. Most importantly a dot ball
19.1
SN Thakur to Chawla, 1 run, off the gloves and into the on-side for a single. That was short, at the body and Chawla was cramped for the pull shot. Jabbed away in the end

SN Thakur to Chawla, wide, angles it across, too wide though and has been wided this time. Right decision

KKR have simply lost too many wickets. The onus now lies on Shubman Gill to deliver the goods. Even 175 looks tough now. But even 175 I don't think is that frightening a score on this track. The last two overs have gone for 11 runs.

SN Thakur to Karthik, out Caught by du Plessis!!Jinxed! Poor from the skipper. Length delivery and he just skied it up in the air for Faf, the ball magnet for the day, to take it at mid-off. That was a nothing shot. The bat face turned in the hands of the batsman for it to sky up. Fourth catch of the day for Faf. Karthik c du Plessis b SN Thakur 18(14) [4s-2]

Now CSK's weaklink will be tested. Thakur and Chahar at the death on a flat-track. But before that let's take a moment out for Tahir. Most possibly a game changing spell from him. Wickets of Lynn and Russell at that time has certainly reduced the probable score by at least 15 runs.

Time for the strategic break. KKR have scored at a brisk pace, but have lost one wicket too many. The loss of Lynn and Russell will hit them hard and they are now left with the final batting pair. 175 should be a par score on this surface but they will have to bowl out of their skins to defend it.

Tahir to A Russell, out Caught by (sub)Shorey!! One shot too many and the celebrations start in the CSK camp - Look at Tahir go, he got Lynn first and now Russell - surely has cut short KKR's final score by at least 25 runs if not more. Another leg-break and Russell brought out an ambitious slog-sweep - Didn't get hold of the shot, off the toe-end and dragged it towards long-on. It was dying onto him, but Dhruv Shorey bent forward and held on. A Russell c (sub)Shorey b Tahir 10(4) [4s-1 6s-1]

Pushed through with a flatter trajectory, Lynn bent down on the slog-sweep, struck it hard and flat, but didn't find the placement that he wanted. Shardul was the man at deep backward square leg, bends down low and accepts the catch gleefully. Exit Lynn, but enter Andre Russell. Chris Lynn c SN Thakur b Tahir 82(51) [4s-7 6s-6]

Chahar to Chris Lynn, no run, first half of the over belonged to the batsman, the next half - to the bowler. Good contest. Chahar keeps this one full and straight, denies him any room and Lynn can do nothing more than whipping it towards mid-on
2.5
Chahar to Chris Lynn, no run, another shortish delivery around off, Chris Lynn walks down the wicket, swings his bat and gets and inside edge towards the left side of Dhoni
2.4

2.3

2.1
Chahar to Chris Lynn, FOUR, that's in the air but it's wide of the fielder at deep mid-wicket. Lynn latches on to the short ball and hacks it over mid-wicket. On a bounce and over the ropes. The fielder near the boundary was sprinting across but couldn't reach there

1.6
SN Thakur to Chris Lynn, 1 run, top over by Shardul Thakur, just two runs off it. Lynn goes hard on his pull and doesn't middle it, the ball can travel as far as square leg and the over ends with a single. Not giving him much room to play with
1.5
SN Thakur to Chris Lynn, no run, pitched on a full length around middle and leg, Chris Lynn whips it towards mid-on, again the timing wasn't perfect
1.4

1.3
SN Thakur to Chris Lynn, no run, 138.3ks, goes full on this one, around the middle and leg stump line, Chris Lynn tries to play across the line and ends up getting a leading edge, back to the bowler
1.2
SN Thakur to Narine, leg byes, 1 run, short in length around the hips and Narine fails to get connection on his glance, off his thigh pad towards short fine leg
1.1
SN Thakur to Narine, no run, that's a fine delivery by Thakur. Short of a length around leg and seams into the batsman, Narine with lack of footwork looks to work across the line but gets beaten due to the hint of movement. Could have easily nicked this had the ball deviated a little less than it actually did
Shardul Thakur, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack

Chahar to Chris Lynn, no run, so two boundaries off the opening over. Chahar bowls a short of a length delivery and Chris Lynn watchfully punches it towards the fielder at mid-off. Just the kind of start the Knight Riders were looking for
0.5
Chahar to Chris Lynn, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries for the opener! This was slightly short in the channel outside off, Chris Lynn treks back and slaps it wide of the fielder at sweeper cover, great timing and power on that
0.4
